Tableau COVID-19 Analysis Project
Overview
This Tableau project analyzes COVID-19 data from February 2023 to March 2023. The dataset includes information on cases, deaths, and case-to-death ratios across U.S. counties and states. The visualizations provide insights into the spread and severity of the pandemic during this period.

Purpose

Visualize COVID-19 case and death trends at both county and state levels.
Calculate and display case-to-death ratios to identify areas with the highest severity.
Provide actionable insights for decision-making and public health strategies.
Features
County-Level Analysis: Displays case-to-death ratios across U.S. counties.
State-Level Analysis: Compares total cases and deaths by state.
Trends and Ratios: Highlights areas with high case-to-death ratios for further investigation.
